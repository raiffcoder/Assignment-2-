               <head>October 26, 1963: Remarks at Amherst College</head>
               <p><persName>Mr. McCloy</persName>, <persName>President Plimpton</persName>,<persName>Mr. MacLeish</persName>, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
                  I am very honored to be here with you on this occasion which means so much to this college and also means so much to art and the progress of the <orgName>United States</orgName>. This college is part of the <orgName>United States</orgName>. It belongs to it. So did Mr. Frost, in a large sense. And, therefore, I was privileged to accept the invitation somewhat rendered to me in the same way that <persName>Franklin Roosevelt</persName> rendered his invitation to <persName>Mr. MacLeish</persName>, the invitation which I received from <persName>Mr. McCloy</persName>. The powers of the Presidency are often described. Its limitations should occasionally be remembered. And therefore when the Chairman of our Disarmament Advisory Committee, who has labored so long and hard, <persName>Governor Stevenson's assistant</persName>  during the very difficult days at the <orgName>United Nations</orgName> during the Cuban crisis, a public servant of so many years, asks or invites the <persName>President of the United States</persName>, there is only one response. So I am glad to be here.
                  Amherst has had many soldiers of the king since its first one, and some of them are here today: Mr. McCloy, who has long been a public servant; Jim Reed, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; President Cole, who is now our Ambassador to Chile; <persName>Mr. Ramey</persName>, who is a Commissioner of the <orgName>Atomic Energy Commission</orgName>; Dick Reuter, who is head of the Food for Peace. These and scores of others down through the years have recognized the obligations of the advantages which the graduation from a college such as this places upon them to serve not only their private interest but the public interest as well.
                  Many years ago, <persName>Woodrow Wilson</persName> said, what good is a political party unless it is serving a great national purpose? And what good is a <orgName>private college or university</orgName> unless it is serving a great national purpose? The library being constructed today, this <orgName>college</orgName>, itself—all of this, of course, was not done merely to give this school's graduates an advantage, an economic advantage, in the life struggle. It does do that. But in return for that, in return for the great opportunity which society gives the graduates of this and related schools, it seems to me incumbent upon this and <persName>other schools' graduates</persName> to recognize their responsibility to the public interest.
            Privilege is here, and with privilege goes responsibility. And I think, as your president said, that it must be a source of satisfaction to you that this school's graduates have recognized it. I hope that the students who are here now will also recognize it in the future. Although Amherst has been in the forefront of extending aid to needy and talented students, private colleges, taken as a whole, draw 50 percent of their students from the wealthiest 10 percent of our Nation. And even State universities and other <orgName>public institutions</orgName> derive 25 percent of their students from this group. In <time>March 1962</time>, persons of 18 years or older who had not completed high school made up 46 percent of the total labor force, and such persons comprised 64 percent of those who were unemployed. And in 1958, the lowest fifth of the families in the United States had 41/2 percent of the total personal income, the highest fifth, 44 1/2 percent. There is inherited wealth in this country and also inherited poverty. And unless the graduates of this college and other colleges like it who are given a running start in life—unless they are willing to put back into our society those talents, the broad sympathy, the understanding, the compassion—unless they are willing to put those qualities back into the service of the Great Republic, then obviously the presuppositions upon which our democracy are based are bound to be fallible.</p>
